Hey y'all! I'm a senior-level software engineer with a CS degree and seven years of professional experience building full-stack web apps. I teach [General Assembly](generalassemb.ly/)'s three-month "Software Engineering Immersive" bootcamp, which means I have a thorough understanding of all aspects of web development and a knack for communicating esoteric technical concepts to people in a clear, understandable way. I thrive in small, flat teams that build things that people enjoy using and make the world a better place. 

Outside of tech, I teach and perform improv comedy and helped produce the annual Out of Bounds Comedy Festival in Austin, TX. I also play a lot of guitar. 

My pronouns are *they/them*.
