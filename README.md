Hey y'all! I'm a **senior-level software engineer** with a **degree in Computer Science** and **eight years of professional experience** building full-stack web applications. I teach [General Assembly](generalassemb.ly/)'s three-month "Software Engineering Immersive" bootcamp, which means I have **a thorough understanding of all aspects of web development** (including front-end, back-end, database, security and dev ops) and **a knack for communicating esoteric technical concepts** to people in a clear, understandable way. I thrive in small, flat teams that build things that people enjoy using and want to make the world a better place. 

Outside of tech, I teach and perform improv comedy and helped produce the annual Out of Bounds Comedy Festival in Austin, TX. I also play a lot of guitar. 

My pronouns are *they/them*.
